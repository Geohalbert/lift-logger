# lift-logger

Motivation for project: 
For many people, the results of a successful workout regiment can be verified by simply looking in the mirror. Eventually, gauging progress with a mirror will become increasingly harder to notice. When the eye test begins to fail, many people choose to log their workouts so that their progress can quantified. Many years ago I was one of these obsessive nerds, using the notes feature on my phone to log my exercises, reps, sets, etc. and then sending that data to a specific email folder. Although I was able to monitor my progress, the process of managing and interpretting the data was messy. This project aims to design a simple and organized approach to this problem. 

I plan on using multiple tech stacks for this project which will be separated via branches.

## Initial tech stack:

- React Native
- Firebase (Realtime database, media storage, authentication, trigger functions)
- React Hooks
- Redux (while not an ideal use of redux, included for the sake of demonstration)
- React-Navigation 4
- Expo

Once the app has basic functionality I will convert to TypeScript and then possibly implement GraphQL
